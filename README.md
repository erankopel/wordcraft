## Why WordCraft

- **Familiar.** Word's ribbon tabs, groups, shortcuts and behaviour: Enter continues a list,
  Tab demotes it, Ctrl/⌘+B bolds the word under the caret, the Styles gallery previews styles live,
  F4 repeats, F7 checks spelling, F8 extends the selection.
- **Your files.** Opens and saves .docx (OOXML), and also .odt, .rtf, .html, .md, .tex (LaTeX), .txt; opens Word 97-2003 .doc; exports PDF
  with real, selectable text, links and bookmarks.
- **Fast.** Paragraph layout is cached, so typing in a 188-page document re-lays it out in about
  1.4 ms; pages render on demand.
- **Everywhere.** One Rust codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux, BSD and the web. No Electron, no
  Tauri: native [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) on the GPU.
- **Built for agents.** Every action is a command with an id. The same 422 commands drive the
  ribbon, keyboard shortcuts, the command search, a command-line tool, a JSON control channel and
  an MCP server.
- **Private.** Spelling, grammar and everything else work offline.
- **Open.** MIT OR Apache-2.0. Clean-room: built from public specifications and observation, with
  every asset original or openly licensed.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft
cd wordcraft
cargo run --release -p wordcraft -- --sample        # the desktop app with the sample document
cargo run --release -p wordcraft -- report.docx     # open a document
```

Command line:

```sh
wordcraft-cli convert report.docx report.pdf        # docx, pdf, odt, rtf, html, md, tex, txt, png
wordcraft-cli text report.docx                      # plain text
wordcraft-cli inspect report.docx                   # structure as JSON
wordcraft-cli run --template sample \
  --cmd 'select.text={"text":"Membership"}' --cmd format.bold --save out.docx
```

Web: `cd apps/wordcraft-web && trunk serve`, then open <http://127.0.0.1:8771/?sample>.

## For agents: CLI and MCP

WordCraft was designed to be driven by people *and* by AI agents.

```sh
claude mcp add wordcraft -- wordcraft-cli mcp                  # headless documents
# confine the agent to folders: wordcraft-cli mcp --automation-read-root DIR --automation-write-root DIR
wordcraft --control 7981 &                                     # or drive the running app…
claude mcp add wordcraft-app -- wordcraft-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7981
```

Tools include `list_commands`, `execute`, `batch`, `type_text`, `select_text`, `inspect_document`,
`render_page`, `save_document`, and, with a running app, `screenshot`, `click` and `key`. Agents
can check their work through `inspect_document` without screenshots. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)
and the [control protocol](docs/control-protocol.md). Macros record any sequence of commands and
play it back (`tools.recordMacro`, `tools.macros`).

## Logs

The desktop app writes its log records to standard error and to `logs/wordcraft.log` next to its
preferences: on Linux `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wordcraft/logs/` (by default `~/.config/wordcraft/logs/`),
on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/WordCraft/logs/`, on Windows `%APPDATA%\WordCraft\logs\`.
A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so this file is what to attach to a bug
report: unreadable parts of a .docx, pictures or fonts a PDF export had to leave out and panics the
command guard recovered from land there. Each launch moves the previous log to `wordcraft.1.log`
(and that one to `wordcraft.2.log`), so the log of a run that crashed survives the next start; a
log stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file, and runs with `WORDCRAFT_NO_PREFS` (agents'
test runs) log to standard error only. Document text is never logged; a panic message leaves out
the text it quotes.

By default WordCraft's own crates log at `info` and everything else at `warn`. `RUST_LOG` replaces
that with env_logger-style directives, for example `RUST_LOG=debug`,
`RUST_LOG=warn,wordcraft_docx=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*`
covers every target starting with it (`wordcraft*=debug`). The logger is
`apps/wordcraft/src/logging.rs`.

On Android the log goes to logcat and to `wordcraft.log` in the first of these folders the app can
write: `Documents/WordCraft/logs/` on shared storage (once All files access is granted, so any file
manager can open and share it), `Android/data/ai.storyteller.wordcraft/files/logs/` (newer Android
versions hide that folder from the file manager), or the private `files/wordcraft/logs/`. From a
computer, `adb logcat -s WordCraft` shows the same records. Each start moves the
previous log to `wordcraft.1.log`, and a log stops growing at 4 MiB. Levels are fixed (`info` for
WordCraft's own crates, `warn` for the rest; `RUST_LOG` is not read), and a panic message leaves
out the text it quotes, as on the desktop. The logger is `apps/wordcraft-android/src/logging.rs`.

## Architecture

| Layer | Crate | Job |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `wordcraft-geom` | units and measurements |
| L1 | `wordcraft-doc`, `wordcraft-fonts`, `wordcraft-proof` | document model and editing; fonts and shaping; spelling, grammar, hyphenation |
| L2 | `wordcraft-layout`, `wordcraft-docx`, `wordcraft-formats` | line breaking, pagination, tables, notes, hit testing; OOXML; ODT/RTF/HTML/Markdown/TXT |
| L3 | `wordcraft-render`, `wordcraft-pdf` | rasteriser (vello_cpu); PDF (krilla) |
| L4 | `wordcraft-engine` | session, undo, 422 commands, Word feature catalog |
| L5 | `wordcraft-mcp` | MCP server |
| L6 | `wordcraft-ui-egui` | the Word-style front end (swappable) |
| apps | `wordcraft`, `wordcraft-cli`, `wordcraft-web`, `wordcraft-android` | desktop, command line, browser, Android (unofficial, sideloaded) |

`cargo xtask ci` runs formatting, clippy, ~800 tests, the asset-attribution check, the layering
check and the wasm build. Contributor and agent instructions: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Roadmap

WordCraft is in **alpha**. It covers 88% of Word's ribbon features with commands today; counting
depth, file fidelity, stability and the rest, we estimate it is about 60% of the way to replacing
all of Word for real work, about 55% for a typical professional's weekly work and about 63% for
everyday essentials. Beta needs testing against real-world .docx files, keeping charts and SmartArt
through a round trip, pagination closer to Word's, a stability sweep and native printing. Details
and estimates: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [where we fall short](docs/gaps.md).

## Downloads

**Download WordCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below except Android (see [Android](#android-sideload-only)), and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\wordcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.

The **32-bit** build uses OpenGL even when a DirectX 12 graphics card is present. On 32-bit
Windows, creating a DirectX 12 graphics pipeline fails immediately and the app exits before the
window appears. `WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan` (or `dx12`) still overrides that.

**If the app quits right after its window appears with "Parent device is lost" in the log:**
WordCraft compiles DirectX 12 shaders with FXC, the compiler built into Windows, so it needs no
`dxcompiler.dll`/`dxil.dll` and ignores any copy another program put on `PATH` (#603).
`WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` (`fxc`, `dxc`, `auto`) overrides this; with `dxc`, a matching
`dxcompiler.dll` *and* `dxil.dll` must sit next to `wordcraft.exe`. `WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"`
also avoids DirectX 12 altogether.

**If the app is slow on an older Windows PC:** when DirectX 12 finds no graphics card with a
driver for it (for example Intel 4th-generation graphics on Windows 11), it only offers Microsoft's
software renderer, which draws every frame on the processor. In that case WordCraft uses OpenGL
instead, without setting anything. The log file records the choice (lines starting with
`graphics:`). `WGPU_BACKEND` still overrides it, e.g. `$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "gl"` or `"dx12"`.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `wordcraft-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Signed and notarized |
| Command-line tool, universal | `wordcraft-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Signed and notarized |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppImage | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.AppImage` | Runs anywhere; updates itself with [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) (`.zsync` files) |
| Flatpak | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.rpm` | |
| Tarball | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` | Unpack anywhere |

RISC-V (riscv64): `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-riscv64.tar.gz`, a tarball cross-compiled for glibc 2.39+
(Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13 and newer).

**Wayland:** on a Wayland desktop the app runs through XWayland when it is available, because
winit (the windowing library) supports dragging files into the window only on X11. To use the
native Wayland backend instead (for example for sharper text with fractional scaling, at the cost
of file drag-and-drop), start it with `WORDCRAFT_WAYLAND=1`:

```sh
WORDCRAFT_WAYLAND=1 wordcraft
```

**Arch Linux (AUR).** Community members maintain three AUR packages; the project doesn't publish
to the AUR itself. Install one of them:
| Package | What it installs | Choose it when |
|---|---|---|
| [`wordcraft-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wordcraft-bin) | The release tarball above, prebuilt (x86_64, aarch64) | You want the latest release without compiling (quickest) |
| [`wordcraft`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wordcraft) | The latest release, built from source with `cargo` | You prefer to build releases yourself |
| [`wordcraft-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wordcraft-git) | The current `main` branch, built from source | You want unreleased changes and accept an occasional broken build |
For example `yay -S wordcraft-bin` or `paru -S wordcraft-bin`.
### FreeBSD

| Build | File |
|---|---|
| x86_64 | `wordcraft-<ver>-freebsd-x86_64.tar.gz` |

### Web (WebAssembly)

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static site | `wordcraft-web-<ver>.zip` | Runs in a modern browser; host it on any static server |

### Android (sideload only)

WordCraft also has an unofficial Android build, for personal use. It is not part of the GitHub
releases and is not published anywhere else: you build the APK yourself with
`packaging/android/package.sh`, or run the Android workflow (`.github/workflows/android.yml`) on
GitHub, and install it on your own device. Build and sideload steps are in
[`packaging/android/README.md`](packaging/android/README.md). The target is a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7
on Android 17 (API 37): minSdk 35, targetSdk 36, compileSdk 37, arm64-v8a only. The app is the same
editor as on the desktop (`wordcraft-ui-egui` over `wordcraft-engine`, eframe with wgpu on Vulkan),
loaded through GameActivity from the `apps/wordcraft-android` crate.

**What has been verified:** the library compiles and links for `aarch64-linux-android`, and the
structure of the APK is checked statically. It has not been run on a physical device or an
emulator, because none was available where it was built, so everything below is untested on
hardware.

- **Touch:** one finger dragging on the page scrolls it and the page coasts after release; a tap
  places the caret (the page gets the press when the finger lifts, so a swipe never edits what it
  starts on); a double tap then a drag selects by words; resting a finger for a moment gives the
  page its press, about half a second in all selects the word and opens the context menu, and a
  picture or a table border held that way can be dragged; two fingers pinch zoom and scroll. In a narrow window (the Fold's
  outer screen) the ribbon's tabs scroll sideways and dialogs scroll inside the window. The ribbon,
  menus and dialogs keep their desktop sizes (the first start sets the interface size to 125
  percent on a screen 600 dp wide or more, 100 percent on a narrower one), so touch targets are
  small, and there are no selection handles and no stylus work. Hyperlinks can't be followed (that
  needs Ctrl+click); a Bluetooth mouse or DeX pointer is treated as a finger, so click-dragging
  scrolls and the wheel does nothing.
- **On-screen keyboard:** winit drops the text GameActivity delivers, so the app reads the
  keyboard's buffer itself and turns it into the editor's input events (`ime.rs`, `keyboard.rs`;
  the text diffing has host tests, including a randomized simulation against a model of Android's
  text buffer). The buffer is kept filled with the text before the caret, so Backspace, capital
  letters and suggestions follow the document, and typed words reach the editor one space or
  punctuation mark at a time, so AutoCorrect, smart quotes and list AutoFormat apply. A keyboard
  button at the right end of the status bar brings the keyboard back after it was dismissed.
  Moving the keyboard's own cursor (a swipe on the space bar) restarts its buffer at the editor's
  caret instead, as does a touch, a release (a button may change the text: Undo, Paste), a pause
  after the editor's own corrections, or a buffer that can't be read; in a dialog's text field
  (Find, the file name) the keyboard gets blank filler instead of the document's text, so the
  first letter there may come capitalised. Pasting more than 64 KiB through the keyboard's
  clipboard suggestion can crash the app. Typing, composing text included, has not been tried on
  a device.
- **Hardware keyboards:** letters and the arrow, Home, End and Page keys work, but Ctrl, Shift and
  Alt are never reported by winit's Android backend, so shortcuts that use them (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+C,
  Shift+arrows) do nothing; use the ribbon and the context menu. Fixing that means a small patch to
  winit.
- **Files:** Open and Save use the built-in file browser over `/storage/emulated/0`, because the
  system file picker needs Java and is not called yet. To list and save in shared storage, grant
  All files access (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) once in Android Settings under Apps, Special app
  access, All files access.
- **Your work:** while the document has unsaved changes a recovery copy is written a moment after
  you stop typing, and at the latest 10 seconds into continuous typing (Android can end a
  backgrounded app without asking, and a paused app draws no frames, so nothing waits for the app
  to be left); the next start offers it back. Closing the app (File, Close) after saving or
  discarding removes it, and a copy that can't be opened is set aside as `unreadable.docx` in the
  app's private folder instead of being deleted (which also means it can't be reached without a
  tool that reads app data). Settings, the custom dictionary, added fonts and the recovery copy
  live in the app's private folder, and uninstalling the app removes them. Fonts are read from
  `/system/fonts`, `/system_ext/fonts`, `/product/fonts`, `/vendor/fonts` and `/odm/fonts`. The app
  and its process end together (File, Close, or when the system finishes the activity), since the
  windowing library can't start a second window in one process; unsaved work comes back from the
  recovery copy at the next start.
- **Not there yet:** a system clipboard bridge (copy and paste work inside the app only), printing,
  opening documents from other apps, the system file picker, selection handles, finger sized
  controls, following hyperlinks, an accessibility bridge (TalkBack), and the hardware keyboard
  modifiers above. The GitHub workflow that builds the APK has not been run yet.
